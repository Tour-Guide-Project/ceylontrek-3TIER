                          The trip was amazing, a once in a lifetime opportunity and trip. My sister and I spent 16 days in Italy for her high school graduation trip, and we had an unparalleled experience. We went from Venice to Florence/Tuscany to Cinque Terre to Sorrento to Rome. Everything in each city and in between was incredible.
